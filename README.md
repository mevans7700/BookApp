# BookApp

####Q1
Write an app that displays a list of books. Each item in the list should show the title of the book and the author's name and age. The starting code has a class BookProvider with some data that you will need to display in the list of books. BookProvider will return a List<String> that contains the title, author's first name, author's last name and author's age. The data will always be in this exact order.

####Q2
Add a simple edit view to the app. Clicking a list item will open the edit view and provide the user a way to change the title of a book. After editing is complete display some feedback to the user to indicate that the title was updated and what the updated title is.

####Q3
Update the app so that the edited title will update the list item title to show the edited title.
